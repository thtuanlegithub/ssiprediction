# Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning Models (GRU, LMTS) with PySpark and Kafka Streaming

## Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and two deep learning models: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory with attention mechanism (LMTS). Additionally, the project implements streaming capabilities using PySpark and Kafka.

## Features
- Utilizes historical stock price data for training and testing.
- Implements GRU and LMTS deep learning models for prediction.
- Integrates PySpark for distributed data processing.
- Utilizes Kafka for real-time data streaming.
